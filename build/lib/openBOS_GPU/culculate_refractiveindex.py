    """
    Perform Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) on a Laplacian array using GPU.

    This function applies SOR to solve linear systems iteratively for each batch of a 
    Laplacian input array. If a GPU is available, computations are performed on the GPU for efficiency.

    Parameters:
    tensor_laplacian (torch.tensor): Input Laplacian array with shape [N, Ly, Lz].
    batch_size (int): Number of samples per batch.If you use CPU for the processing,Batchsize=1 is recomennded.
    device (str) : 'cuda' or 'cpu'
    omega_SOR (float): Relaxation factor for SOR, controls the convergence speed.
    e (float): Tolerance for stopping the iterative process based on residual.
    tolerance (float): The difference threshold for loss change to consider convergence stable.
    max_stable_iters (int): Maximum number of iterations with stable residuals allowed for convergence.

    Returns:
    np.ndarray: The SOR-processed array concatenated across all batches.
